"""Bring up perception, agent, and the cobot2_ws bridge.

This ws no longer owns any robot/gripper execution -- robot_node.py (its own
Doosan/gripper control) and wrist_grasp_node.py (GraspGenX precision grasp,
whose only consumer was robot_node) were removed once cobot2_ws's pick_fsm
became the sole executor (팀 컨벤션 문서 #3). vla_pick_bridge_node is now the only
thing that turns an agent decision into a motion, by forwarding to pick_fsm
over /vla/pick_command -- it never moves an arm itself.

enable_pick_bridge defaults off here so a bare launch (e.g. running tests, or
perception-only debugging) never fires a command at cobot2_ws by accident;
turn it on deliberately when cobot2_ws's pick_fsm is actually up. This alone
does not start pick_fsm's cycle either: it sits in IDLE until /pick/start is
called (a human button, or cobot2_ws's own vla_command_node with
auto_start:=true -- a different launch file in a different clone, not started
from here). See README.md #3 "enable_pick_bridge:=true만으로는...".
